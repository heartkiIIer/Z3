This project developed Z3-Wellness, an interactive web application to combat 
the poor sleep health of college age students. Studies have shown that up to 
62% of college students meet the criteria for poor sleep, affecting grade point 
averages, learning retention, and ultimately, alter their future careers of 
college students. The app includes sleep, caffeine, stress, exercise tracking, 
personality tests, mindfulness modules, bedtime routines, and integration with 
Fitibit. Upon completion, Z3-Wellness is a fully functional and engaging 
application incorporating multiple scientifically proven methods to improve 
sleep health.
