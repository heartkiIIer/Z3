	This project developed Z3-Wellness, an interactive web application to combat the poor sleep health of college age students. 
	Studies have shown that up to 62% of college students meet the criteria for poor sleep, and up to 50% exhibit daytime sleepiness. 
	The app includes sleep, caffeine, stress, exercise tracking, personality tests, mindfulness modules, bedtime routines, and integration with Fitibit. 
	These elements all help to improve the sleep health of the user. For a continuation of this project, further development of 
	the mindfulness modules, as well as integration with other popular fitness trackers is recommended.
